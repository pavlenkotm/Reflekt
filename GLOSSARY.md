**Gas Limit** - The maximum amount of gas you're willing to spend on a transaction.

**Gas Price** - The amount you're willing to pay per unit of gas, typically measured in Gwei.

**Gwei** - A denomination of ETH equal to 0.000000001 ETH, commonly used for gas prices.

## H

**Hardhat** - A development environment for Ethereum software, including compilation, deployment, and testing tools.

## K

**Keccak256** - The hashing algorithm used by Ethereum.

**Keystore** - An encrypted file containing a private key, protected by a password.

## L

**Layer 1 (L1)** - The base blockchain layer (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, Cardano).

**Layer 2 (L2)** - Scaling solutions built on top of L1 blockchains (e.g., Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon).

**Liquidity Pool** - A collection of funds locked in a smart contract, used for decentralized trading.

## M

**Mainnet** - The primary public blockchain network where real transactions occur.

**Mempool** - The waiting area for unconfirmed transactions before they're added to a block.

**Merkle Tree** - A data structure used to efficiently verify blockchain data integrity.

**MetaMask** - A popular browser extension and mobile wallet for interacting with Ethereum DApps.

**Mint** - The process of creating new tokens or NFTs.

**Move** - A programming language for smart contracts, used by Aptos and Sui.

## N

**NFT (Non-Fungible Token)** - A unique digital asset that cannot be replicated or divided, commonly used for art, collectibles, and gaming items.

**Node** - A computer that participates in a blockchain network by validating and relaying transactions.

**Nonce** - A number used once, crucial for transaction ordering and mining.

## O

**Oracle** - A service that provides external data to smart contracts.

**Optimistic Rollup** - An L2 scaling solution that assumes transactions are valid by default.

## P

**PDA (Program Derived Address)** - A deterministic address in Solana derived from a program ID and seeds.

**Plutus** - The smart contract platform for Cardano, using Haskell.

**Private Key** - A secret number that allows you to access and control your cryptocurrency. Never share this!

**Proof of Stake (PoS)** - A consensus mechanism where validators stake tokens to secure the network.

**Proof of Work (PoW)** - A consensus mechanism where miners compete to solve computational puzzles.

**Public Key** - A cryptographic key that can be shared publicly, derived from your private key.

## R

**Reentrancy** - A smart contract vulnerability where a function can be called multiple times before the first execution completes.

**RPC (Remote Procedure Call)** - A protocol for interacting with blockchain nodes programmatically.

## S

**Seed Phrase** - A list of words (usually 12 or 24) that can recover your wallet. Keep this secret!

**Smart Contract** - Self-executing code on a blockchain that automatically enforces agreements.

**Solidity** - The most popular programming language for Ethereum smart contracts.

**Staking** - Locking up cryptocurrency to support network operations and earn rewards.

## T

**Testnet** - A test blockchain network for development, using tokens with no real value.
